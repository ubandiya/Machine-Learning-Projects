# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects based on well-known datasets such as the Iris, Breast Cancer, and Customer Churn datasets. These projects are designed to explore various machine learning techniques using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-Learn. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, including classification, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more.

## Datasets

### 1. Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

**Project Idea:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features.
- Apply various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the iris species.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 2. Breast Cancer Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict whether a tumour is malignant or benign based on features computed from a digitised image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

**Project Idea:**
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalising the features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM.
- Use cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters and improve model performance.
- Analyse feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the classification.

### 3. Customer Churn Dataset
The Customer Churn dataset is focused on predicting whether a customer will leave a company or continue using its services. This dataset includes features related to customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns.

**Project Idea:**
- Conduct data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and dealing with class imbalance.
- Develop machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to predict customer churn.
- Implement techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
- Evaluate model performance using AUC-ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and other relevant metrics.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary Python libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own directory. You can navigate to the relevant directory and run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file to see the code and outputs. The notebooks are structured to guide you through the process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

For example, to run the Iris classification project:

```bash
cd Iris
jupyter notebook Iris_Classification.ipynb
```
