# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects based on well-known datasets such as the Iris, Breast Cancer, and Customer Churn datasets. These projects are designed to explore various machine learning techniques using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-Learn. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, including classification, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more.

## Datasets

### 1. Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

**Project Idea:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features.
- Apply various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the iris species.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 2. Breast Cancer Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict whether a tumour is malignant or benign based on features computed from a digitised image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

**Project Idea:**
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalising the features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM.
- Use cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters and improve model performance.
- Analyse feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the classification.

### 3. Customer Churn Dataset
The Customer Churn dataset is focused on predicting whether a customer will leave a company or continue using its services. This dataset includes features related to customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns.

**Project Idea:**
- Conduct data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and dealing with class imbalance.
- Develop machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to predict customer churn.
- Implement techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
- Evaluate model performance using AUC-ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and other relevant metrics.
